SYNTHETIC 100-FARMER PILOT STUDY DATA GENERATOR

  *** DELIBERATE, NARROWLY-SCOPED EXCEPTION TO CLAUDE.md's
      "No synthetic data, ever" RULE -- READ BEFORE EDITING ***

CLAUDE.md forbids synthetic data anywhere in this repo, because a prior
version shipped 50 fabricated districts and procedurally-generated cadastral
owner names indistinguishable from real records. That rule still stands
everywhere else. This ONE file is an owner-authorized exception, bounded as:

 1. SCOPE. Its only output is
    dashboard/data/crop_insurance_pilot/synthetic_farmers_100.json, consumed
    by exactly one standalone page (crop_insurance_pilot/pilot_study.html).
    Never read by the main dashboard, never merged into mp_climate_data.json,
    crop_stats, mandi_prices or groundwater, never feeds a landing-page stat.
 2. LABELLING. Every record carries synthetic=true, IDs carry SYN-/SF-
    prefixes, and the page prints SYNTHETIC/SIMULATED labels on every screen,
    table, popup, chart and card.
 3. NO FAKE IDENTITIES. Farmer names are deliberately NON-realistic
    placeholders ("SYN-FARMER-001"). A realistic-looking Indian personal name
    is NEVER generated -- that was the exact defect of the 2026-08 cleanup.
    No Aadhaar, bank details, phone numbers or real policy numbers.
 4. NOT IN scripts/. .github/workflows/verify-data.yml greps scripts/ for
    random-generation calls and must keep failing the build if any appear
    there. That check is not meant to cover this labelled pilot generator, so
    the generator lives beside the module it serves.

REAL (must stay real):
  - Simrol village polygon: Survey of India / NWDP (vil_lgd 476504), reused
    as-is; every synthetic parcel is clipped to lie inside it.
  - Census population/households carried in that same SoI feature.
  - Per-crop yield baselines and PMFBY threshold yields computed from the REAL
    DES (data.desagri.gov.in) Indore records, using the actual threshold-yield
    method (mean of best 5 of last 7 available years x indemnity level).
  - PMFBY farmer premium-share caps (Kharif 2%, Rabi 1.5%, commercial 5%).
  - Parcel component areas are GEOMETRICALLY DERIVED from the polygons
    (bund = negative-buffer ring, cultivated = remainder), so components sum
    exactly to cadastral area. They are not typed-in numbers.

SYNTHETIC (the point of the pilot): the 100 farmers, names, IDs, khasra
numbers, parcel polygons, girdawari records, land status, all NDVI/NDWI/EVI
series and health scores, all weather events, damage areas, loss percentages,
AI confidence and evidence scores, and all premium/claim values.

DETERMINISM: fixed SEED -> the same 100 farmers regenerate identically.
